This is a simple Chip8 Assembler I have been working on.
This will be used in conjunction with my Chip8 Emulator found here: https://github.com/jonesdy/Chip8-Emulator
More information about Chip8 can be found at: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8 or http://www.chip8.com/

I have been writing this almost completely on my own, so it's likely to have bugs.
This is also my first time writing an assembler.
